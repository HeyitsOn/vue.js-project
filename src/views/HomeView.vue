<h1>Welcome to my Portfolio</h1>
<p>
I'm a full-stack web development student at Life Choices Academy, currently seeking an 
internship related to software development.
My enthusiasm lies in robotics and cybersecurity, 
with a specific passion for robotics, where I can use code to impact people's lives by creating realistic
approaches to everyday life with simulated intelligence assistance.
As a writer passionate about technology, 
this propels my drive to create projects and solutions that will one day change a person's life.
